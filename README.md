# CoupBot
This Discord bot allows any* user to form a coup attempt on the owner of the server. During that time, both the ruler and the challenger must gather the support of the server.

- The ruler and challenger get 48 hours* or until more than half of the points are distributed to either party.
- Each user votes for one party, but their vote is worth as many messages as they have sent in the server; the support of more active users are more important.
[x] - The votes of moderators are worth 1.5x* and those of administrators 2x*. The ruler must give his advisers a reason to keep him around. Currently on hold.
- If the ruler loses, they must transfer ownership of the server. If the challenger loses, they are subject to public humiliation (forfeits to be improved in the future).

\* denotes the value can be customised
